# Covid-QR-code-reader
Use phone camera to scan and decode Covid19 vaccine QR code
This is my starter project using Pydroid3 or whatever IDE I can find to install on my tablet (Android8) or mobile phone (Android12).
The object is to read and decode Covid vaccine QR codes, preferably using the built camera on the phone.
The intial step was to find someone else's script to read these QR codes and copy it. (I'm not too proud to copy.)
The first effort was on a PC in the 'Thonny' IDE and after some adjustment it worked, eventually.
The adjustment was required as the script and instructions I had copied were for a slightly different hardware configuration.
It required that I read the QR code using A.N.Other QR code reader, as can be found on any smartphone, and copy the resulting string into my program.
After downloading Pydroid3 onto my tablet and some further modifications this ran successfully.
At this point it still required the slightly klunky reading the QR code externally and doing a cut&paste transfer.
Current stage (19/Dec/21) is searching for some way to get Pydroid3, or any other Python IDE to read the QR code AND run my script.
